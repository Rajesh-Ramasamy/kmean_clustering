Dataset: Latitude and Longitude of major indian cities.

This example is just for understanding, the city/state map used is for representation purpose only.

When the number of clusters are 2, cities are grouped as North India and South India as the algorithm clusters the values based on their 'distance' from centroids. 

You can relate the 'distance' between two points as the geographical distance between two cities.

When the clusters are 4, the cities are grouped under North, East, West, South India.

When the clusters are 28, the cities are grouped under different states.

Cities are repesented by the symbol "." dot, the clusters are represented by the colours and the centroids are represented by the symbol "x".
